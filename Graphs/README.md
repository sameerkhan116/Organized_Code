# Graphs

A graph is a data structure that consists of of vertices (nodes) and edges.
Graphs are best represented by:

1.  Adjacency matrix
2.  Adjacency List

BFS in graphs is very similar to BFS in trees, except, a graph may contain cycles. To avoid this, we use a boolean of visited arrays. Time Complexity: O(V + E).
